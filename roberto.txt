## Roberto's `!submit` command
To help us track formations, the`!submit` command forwards messages to the 📌 channels.
- **Anyone** can use it. Simply reply to the message you would like to submit, type !submit, and hit enter.
- Please use the `!submit` command for new formations, noteworthy benchmarks, team damage comparisons, etc.
- **Please remember to include author credits, damage spread, and investment screenshots in your message *before* submitting.** If our submissions are missing information, you will simply end up waiting longer for a graphic because our team will have to scrub through the chat until we track down who made the team/which team you used, etc.
- <@&1333544340437340277> will react with 📝 for any message that has been submitted but don't be afraid of accidentally submitting twice.
